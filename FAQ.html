      <h4 style='color: #000'>What is cognitive automation?</h4>

      <h4 style='color: #000'>Why should I work with Hank?</h4>
      <p>
        Hank is unique amongst his peers.  He will reward you for your efforts at training him.  You can choose between receiving cash now or receiving a portion of the profits generated by the model you helped to train.

      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <h4 style='color: #000'>How will Hank generate a profit?</h4>
      <p>
        When Hank has obtained enough feedback, he will be as proficient as his human trainers at selecting the correct medical codes for a given case.  At that point, he will be deployed in place of some medical coders.

      <h4 style='color: #000' >What are the 'content contribution requirements' for becoming a contributing user?</h4>
      <p>
        Each time you provide quality feedback to Hank, you'll earn credit toward your monthly user costs. Once you've provided enough quality feedback, your monthly costs will be reduced to zero.  But that's not the end of the story.  You can continue providing feedback to earn cash back or participate in our profit sharing program.  In addition, Hank may store a portion of the records you've submitted in a fully deidentified format for future training purposes.

      <h4 style='color: #000' >How will I provide feedback to Hank?</h4>
      <p>
        Your feedback will be in the form of a free text explanation, but you will be provided with standard phrasing to use when correcting codes to ensure Hank understands what he got wrong.  Your adherence to our suggested phrasing will be a part of how your feedback is rated.

        Yes.  Hank goes to great lengths to ensure that no protected health information is compromised.  Records are checked locally and stripped of PHI prior to cloud processing and then checked and stripped again with even more powerful algorithms after they are received by our HIPAA compliant servers.
